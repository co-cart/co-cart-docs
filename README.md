This repository manages the documentation for CoCart.

If you would like to contribute to the documentation to either correct a mistake, maybe add another language or something else. Then please follow these [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Started

#### Requirements

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or macOS** ‚Äî Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **[Ruby, version 2.5 or newer](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)**
 - **[Bundler](https://bundler.io/)** ‚Äî If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.
 - **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)**

#### Getting Set Up

1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Clone *your forked repository* (not this original one) to your hard drive with `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/co-cart-docs.git`
3. `cd co-cart-docs`
4. Initialize and start Slate. You can either do this locally, or with Vagrant:

```shell

bundle exec middleman build  ## Just build the files.

# OR run this to run with vagrant
