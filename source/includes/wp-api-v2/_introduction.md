# What is CoCart? #

CoCart, also written as co-cart, is a REST API for WooCommerce. Accessing the cart via the REST API was highly requested by mobile and app developers and was missing from the core of WooCommerce.

So I built it. Tada!

It allows you to use WooCommerceâ€™s REST API to its full potential providing the option to create a full web or mobile app ðŸ“± for your store powered by WooCommerce.

The current WooCommerce REST API is version `v2`. The same for CoCart. The namespace matches with the current version to keep all endpoints together when [viewing the index](https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/#index).

The cart endpoint also registers before WooCommerce endpoints in order for the index of WC REST API to be in alphabetical order.

## Requirements ##

To use the latest version of the CoCart you must be using:

* WordPress 4.4 or later.
* WooCommerce 3.0.x or later.
* Pretty permalinks in `Settings > Permalinks` so that the custom endpoints are supported. **Default permalinks will not work.**
* You may make requests over either HTTP or HTTPS, but HTTPS is recommended where possible.

Please note that you are <strong>not</strong> required to install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/">WP REST API (WP API)</a> plugin.

## Request/Response Format ##

The default response format is JSON. Requests with a message-body use plain JSON to set or update resource attributes. Successful requests will return a `200 OK` HTTP status.

Some general information about response:

* Resource IDs are returned as integers.
* Other amounts, such as item counts, are returned as integers.
* Blank fields are generally included as `null` instead of being returned as blank strings or omitted.

## Errors ##

Occasionally you might encounter errors when accessing the REST API. There are four possible types:

| Error Code | Error Type |
|------------|------------|
| `400 Bad Request` | Invalid request, e.g. using an unsupported HTTP method |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Authentication or permission error, e.g. incorrect API keys |
| `404 Not Found` | Requests to resources that don't exist or are missing |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Server error |

> WP REST API error example

```json
{
  "code": "rest_no_route",
  "message": "No route was found matching the URL and request method",
  "data": {
    "status": 404
  }
}
```
> CoCart error example

```json
{
  "code": "wc_cart_rest_clear_cart_failed",
  "message": "Clearing the cart failed!",
  "data": {
    "status": 500
  }
}
```

Errors return both an appropriate HTTP status code and response object which contains a `code`, `message` and `data` attribute.

## Parameters ##

Almost all endpoints accept optional parameters which can be passed as a HTTP query string parameter, e.g. `POST /cart/?cart_item_key=270edd69788dce200a3b395a6da6fdb7&quantity=2`. All parameters are documented along each endpoint.
