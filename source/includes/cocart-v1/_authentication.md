# Authentication #

CoCart can be authenticated by various methods with the WP REST API, first being via the [REST API keys](http://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/#rest-api-keys) in [WooCommerce](http://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/#authentication). Though this method is designed for the backend, with some custom coding you can make it work for the frontend.

Checkout my guide on [how to authenticate with WooCommerce](https://cocart.xyz/authenticating-with-woocommerce-heres-how-you-can-do-it/).

It is also possible to authenticate using any of the following WP REST API authentication plugins or methods.

* [JWT Authentication for WP REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jwt-authentication-for-wp-rest-api/)
