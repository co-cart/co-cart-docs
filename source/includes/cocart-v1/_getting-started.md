Visit the [WooCommerce server requirements documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements/) for a detailed list of server requirements.

### Automatic installation ###

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of CoCart, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click **Add New**.

In the search field type “CoCart” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

## CoCart WordPress Plugin ##

CoCart is a free, open-source WordPress plugin that provides a REST API for WooCommerce to access the front-end features of your store.

## Recommended Version ##

For the most stable and performance experience, it’s recommended that you use the most recent version of the plugin. You can get the [latest releases here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/).

Of course, as new features are in development, feel free to check out the latest develop branch or check out any [other release](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/releases).

## GitHub - Download / Clone Plugin ##

CoCart is available on GitHub: <https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart>

You can download the plugin or clone the plugin from GitHub.

Add the downloaded/cloned plugin to your WordPress plugin directory. On a typical WordPress install, this is located at `/wp-content/plugins`.

<aside class="notice">
    <strong>Install Directory</strong><br/><br/>To minimize risk of unintended behavior, it’s best for your plugin directory to be "cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce" and not something else, like "cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce-master" or "cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce-develop".
