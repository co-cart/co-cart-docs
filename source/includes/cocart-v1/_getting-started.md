## CoCart WordPress Plugin ##

CoCart is a free, open-source WordPress plugin that provides a REST API for WooCommerce to access the front-end features of your store.

## Recommended Version ##

For the most stable and performance experience, it’s recommended that you use the most recent version of the plugin. You can see the [latest releases here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/).

Of course, as new features are in development, feel free to check out the latest develop branch or check out any other feature or release.

## GitHub - Download / Clone Plugin ##

CoCart is available on GitHub: <https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart>

You can download the plugin or clone the plugin from GitHub.

Add the downloaded/cloned plugin to your WordPress plugin directory. On a typical WordPress install, this is located at /`wp-content/plugins`.

    <strong>Install Directory</strong>

    To minimize risk of unintended behavior, it’s best for your plugin directory to be "cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce" and not something else, like "cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce-master" or "cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce-develop".
