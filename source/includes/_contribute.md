# Contribute #

If you or your company use CoCart or appreciate the work Iâ€™m doing in open source, please consider supporting me directly so I can continue maintaining it and keep evolving the project. It's pretty clear that software actually costs something, and even though it may be offered freely, somebody is paying the cost.

You'll be helping to ensure I can spend the time not just fixing bugs, adding features, releasing new versions, but also keeping the project afloat. Any contribution you make is a big help and is greatly appreciated.

If you want to do a one-time donation, you can donate to [my PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/codebreaker).

Thank you for your support! ðŸ™Œ
