If you or your company use CoCart or appreciate the work I’m doing in open source, please consider [purchasing CoCart Pro](https://cocart.xyz/pricing/?utm_medium=docs.cocart.xyz&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=contribute&utm_content=cocart-docs) where you not just get the full cart experience but also support me directly so I can continue maintaining CoCart and keep evolving the project.

Please also consider starring ✨ and sharing 👍 the project repo! This helps the project getting known and grow with the community. 🙏

Thank you for your support! 🙌
